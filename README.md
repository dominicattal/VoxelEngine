Voxel Engine

Coded from scatch using three dependencies:
GLFW
GLAD
STB_IMAGE

Linear math done by me (very proud)

Can render cube at location in 3D space

Code is messy and I want to work on other stuff, so this project is abandoned.
I'll probably try again another day, I learned a lot from this attempt.
